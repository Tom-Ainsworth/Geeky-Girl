## **User Experience**

---

In this section, We are going to provide insights into my UX process, mainly focusing on who this web application is built for, what they intent to achieve and how they can best utilise this web application to fulfil their needs.

According to Caglar Araz from UX Collective, User Experience (UX) is "User experience refers to the singular and accumulated experiences that occur for users as a consequence of them interacting with an object in a given context."

The planning and development of this project is divided into 5 planes:

1. The Strategy Plane
2. The Scope Plane
3. The Structure Plane
4. The Skeleton Plane
5. The Surface Plane

## **Strategy Plane**

### Creator Goals

-   to create an interactive web application that is fully responsive on desktop to smaller devices such as mobile.

-   to create a website with interface design, presenting a logical structure allowing users to easily navigate.

-   to build a site that female users will find enriching and rewarding following our roadmap to becoming a software developer.

### User Stories

-   As a first-time user, I would like the purpose of the website to be clear and straight forward.

-   As a first-time user, I would like to be able to navigate to desired sections on the site without having to search and scroll.

## **Scope Plane**

-   A simple home page with responsive navigation bar to allow user to easily navigate without having to scroll and to show the purpose of the website.

-   Simple roadmap design that is visually appealing, non-distracting and easy to follow.

-   Interview preparations and many more resources provided in different sections of the site so users can easily access to gain knownledge in becoming a software dev.

### Design

Our desire is to design a web application that is clean and crisp with minimal distractions. All the fonts and styles are consistent throughout the site to make the users feel comfortable. With the help of CSS styles and media queries, the site is responsive across devices from desktop, laptop, tablet to mobile. Even on smaller devices, the contents are aligned proportionally and styled to make sure they are still legible and well-displayed. Altogether, the design and layout of the site should be entertaining and captivating so that a user is able to understand and enjoy the site.

### Typography

The fonts I have chosen for the site is Zilla Slab with Sans Serif as a fall back.

The website is fully responsive across all devices with the help of CSS styling and media queries to custom font sizes (smaller for mobile devices) and styles to keep all the content in place and legible.

### Colour Scheme

## **Features**

This project is neat and straight forward. It is logically designed whilst also keeping design consistency in all aspects of the page. The navigation bar allows easy navigation with faster, more efficient access to the desired content. It stays fixed on top of the page. It is responsive across different resolutions and collapses according to screen size at 768px width or smaller to encourage a user-friendly and minimalist design. Hover effect is used in all links and icons to add a bit of animation to the site to make it more appealing and to reinforce the links are clickable. The links will open a new tab so that the user does not leave the site. The use of CSS and media queries have allowed the site to be responsive across various devices.


### Home page

- Large quintessential Hero image, with heading text laid on top, is in the header of the home page to draw the attention of the users and to encourage users to read more. 

- Brief intro on the current state of the industry for women and statements regarding pay disparity between genders. The Narbar provides direct links to all section of the site. The footer contains social links to allow users to connect with site owner.
