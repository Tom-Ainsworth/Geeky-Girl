## **User Experience**

---

In this section, We are going to provide insights into my UX process, mainly focusing on who this web application is built for, what they intent to achieve and how they can best utilise this web application to fulfil their needs.

According to Caglar Araz from UX Collective, User Experience (UX) is "User experience refers to the singular and accumulated experiences that occur for users as a consequence of them interacting with an object in a given context."

The planning and development of this project is divided into 5 planes:

1. The Strategy Plane
2. The Scope Plane
3. The Structure Plane
4. The Skeleton Plane
5. The Surface Plane

## **Strategy Plane**

### Creator Goals
* to create an interactive web application that is fully responsive on desktop to smaller devices such as mobile.

* to create a website with interface design, presenting a logical structure allowing users to easily navigate.

* to build a site that female users will find enriching and rewarding following our roadmap to becoming a software developer.

### User Stories
* As a first-time user, I would like the purpose of the website to be clear and straight forward.

* As a first-time user, I would like to be able to navigate to desired sections on the site without having to search and scroll.

* As a first-time user, I would like to easily access resources and guidance on becoming a software dev.


## **Scope Plane**
* A simple home page with responsive navigation bar to allow user to easily navigate without having to scroll and to show the purpose of the website.

* Simple roadmap design that is visually appealing, non-distracting and easy to follow.

* Interview preparations and many more resources provided in different sections of the site so users can easily access to gain knownledge in becoming a software dev.

* Testimonials are shared on the Success Stories section to encourage and motivate users to follow our guide to reach their goals and offer reassurance.

* The design of the website should be visually consistent across all aspects to make it visually pleasing and comfortable for users.

* The web application should be responsive across different resolutions.
